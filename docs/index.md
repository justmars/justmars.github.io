Hi, I'm Mars and this is a blog. The last time I tried a personal blog like this was the dawn of the internet. Google was a startup, Geocities was still alive, and Dreamweaver was a thing. I started to code again in 2019ish, sometime after law school. This is an attempt to record notes and things I've learned, in the futile hope that I don't forget them.
